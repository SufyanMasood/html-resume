            <b><li>Religion</li></b>
        The most important thing to me is Islam.
        I am a dedicated Muslim who prioritizes my daily religious obligations, and I
        do not put anything above those obligiations.
            <br /><br />
            <b><li>Family</li></b>
        After my religion, is my family. My family has sacrificed a lot for me,
        and so I work very hard to make them proud. 
            <br /><br />
            <b><li>Fitness</li></b>
        I value fitness because I believe our bodies are a trust given by God.
        We must take care of our bodies and make sure we are strong and able to
        fulfill our responsibilities.
